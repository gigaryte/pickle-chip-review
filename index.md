## Lays Dill Pickle

### Bottom-Line, Up-Front

Advertised as "tangy", "tart", "crispy", and "mouthwatering", this thin, classic
potato chip lives up to its billing. But the thin slice of the potato combined
with its greasiness and saltiness detract from the overall pickle chip
experience. This is the Honda Civic of of pickle chips &mdash; it'll get you
from point A to point B, but you won't look cool doing it.
