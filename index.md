#### Review: 

Advertised as "tangy", "tart", and "crispy", this thin, classic
potato chip lives up to its billing. But the thin slice of the potato combined
with its greasiness and saltiness detract from the overall pickle chip
experience. This is the Honda Civic of of pickle chips &mdash; it'll get you
from point A to point B, but you won't look cool doing it.

Lays Dill Pickle chips use the same base potato chip as the classic yellow-bag
Lays. They're medium-sized chips that are cut extremely thinly, rendering them
prone to folding during the cooking process and breaking on their journey to
your mouth. These chips are non-ruffled and have a fairly smooth texture with no
noticeable skin present. As with classic Lays, the dill pickle variety is salty
to the point of being obnoxious &mdash; you're going to need a beverage to pair
with these crisps and you might feel your face start to tingle after eating a
few handfuls. Further, while the dill pickle flavor isn't necessarily bad, it's
extremely sour. After eating a generous-but-reasonable helping, the snacker may
feel their tongue start to feel raw and sensitive, diminishing their appeal. 

In sum, the Lays Dill Pickle chips will get the job done if you're in a pickle,
but nothing more. Their saltiness and sourness are major cons, and the chip
itself is nothing to write home about. Snack on these chips only if you can't
find anything better.
